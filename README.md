## Getting started

On OS X (10.7+):

*   Download and expand this zip:    
    https://github.com/munki/contrib/raw/master/mwa2_demo.zip

*   Via the command-line, run the script within the expanded zip:
    `/Users/me/Downloads/mwa2_demo/run_mwa2.sh`

*   Follow the script prompts. Of note, at one place you'll be advised to edit a settings file. Specifically, you'll edit `mwa2/munkiwebadmin/settings.py`. Near the end of this file is this:

```python
# MUNKI_REPO_DIR holds the local filesystem path to the Munki repo
MUNKI_REPO_DIR = '/Users/Shared/munki_repo'
```

*   Edit `MUNKI_REPO_DIR` to point to a Munki repo to use with MWA2. Please don't point it at your production repo unless you like living very dangerously.

*   Once all the setup task are complete, a development server will be launched, and MWA2 should be available at http://localhost:8080
